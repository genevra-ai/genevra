## Usage
### Command Line Interface
The genevra CLI provides several commands for genomic analysis and AI model management:

1. Analyze genomic sequences:

```bash
genevra analyze \
    --input data/sequences/*.fastq \
    --output results/ \
    --min-quality 30 \
    --reference ref/hg38.fa

2. Train AI models:

```bash
genevra train \
    --data training/dataset/ \
    --model-config configs/model.json \
    --output models/ \
    --epochs 100 \
    --mixed-precision
```

3. Run inference:

```bash
genevra infer \
    --model transformer-v1 \
    --input data/test/*.fastq \
    --output predictions/ \
    --batch-size 32 \
    --gpu
```

4. Manage models:

### List available models

```bash
genevra manage list
```

### Download a specific model

```bash
genevra manage download model-id --version 1.0.0
```

### Upload a new model

```bash
genevra manage upload path/to/model --name "my-model"
```

## Configuration
Create a configuration file config.json:

```json
{
    "hardware": {
        "num_threads": 8,
        "use_gpu": true,
        "memory_limit": "16G"
    },
    "analysis": {
        "min_quality": 30,
        "min_coverage": 10,
        "reference_genome": "path/to/reference.fa"
    },
    "model": {
        "architecture": "transformer",
        "batch_size": 32,
        "mixed_precision": true
    }
}
```
